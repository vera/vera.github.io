This page contains my master's thesis (Software Updates for the Internet of Things: An Extension and Evaluation of the SUIT Implementation in RIOT) which I wrote at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg in 2021.

I created this page using HTML5 and CSS3. It uses the new HTML semantic tags, e.g. `figure`, `nav` and `section`, CSS flexboxes and grids, CSS scroll snapping, CSS counters and CSS animations.

This page can be seen live at [veraclemens.org](https://veraclemens.org).

See [my other repository](https://github.com/vera/masters-thesis) for source code and evaluation data.
