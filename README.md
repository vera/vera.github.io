This page contains my master's thesis (Software Updates for the Internet of Things: An Extension and Evaluation of the SUIT Implementation in RIOT) which I wrote in the [Communication and Networked Systems working group](https://comsys.ovgu.de) of Prof. Dr. Güneş at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg in 2021.

I created this page using HTML5 and CSS3. It uses the new HTML semantic tags, e.g. `figure`, `nav` and `section`, CSS flexboxes and grids, CSS scroll snapping, CSS counters and CSS animations.

This page can be seen live at [veraclemens.org](https://veraclemens.org).

The PDF version of the thesis can be downloaded [from the working group's website](https://comsys.ovgu.de/comsys_media/thesis/finished/MSc/2021+_+Vera+Clemens+Software+Updates+for+the+Internet+of+Things-p-524.pdf).

See [my other repository](https://github.com/vera/masters-thesis) for source code and evaluation data.
