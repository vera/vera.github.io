This page contains my master's thesis (Software Updates for the Internet of Things: An Extension and Evaluation of the SUIT Implementation in RIOT) which I wrote at the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg in 2021.

I created this page using HTML5 and CSS3.

This page can be seen live at [veraclemens.org](https://veraclemens.org).

See [my other repository](https://github.com/vera/masters-thesis) for source code and evaluation data.

**TODOs**:

- Automatically generate table of contents
